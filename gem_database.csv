Originally (since 1917) it came only from the Maxixe Mine in Minas Gerais (Brazil). More recently beryl from multiple sources has been sold as 'Maxixe', which has lead to many in gemmological circles preferring to use the terms 'Blue Beryl' or 'Maxixe-type beryl'. 

Since the 1970s it has been more widely available and enhanced through irradiation, but the colour fades after prolonged exposure to light or heat although it is much slower with indoor lighting.","https://www.gemdat.org/gphotos/0058257001357819539.jpg","Blue Beryl (Maxixe)","N/A","Natural","Diffusion","N/A","12.44 cts.","15.7mm x 11.9mm x ?","N/A"

10272,"Garnet Group","Garnet is extensively used as a gem. The name is said to have been derived from the colour of the gem varieties, red garnets having been compared to the flowers and seeds of the pomegranate-tree.

The most common colour of Garnet is red, the most usual tones being tinged with brown, yellow and violet. Green garnet, the colour of which is similar to that of the emerald, though usually more yellowish or brownish, is also cut as a gem, but less frequently. Black garnets also occur and are used in mourning jewellery. Blue is a colour conspicuous by its complete absence in the garnet group. 

Amongst all varieties there are numerous specimens of perfect clearness and transparency, sometimes combined with the deepest and darkest shade of colour which are cut as gems.

Garnet is a name given to a group of closely related silicate minerals sharing the same isometric structure. In mineralogy the term garnet has been expanded to include other non-silicate minerals with the same structure, but in gemmological usage, garnet relates specifically to the various mineral species listed below.","https://www.gemdat.org/gphotos/0449973001350853617.jpg","Hessonite","Madagascar","Natural","None reported","Oval","22.77 cts.","19.28mm x 14.58mm x 9.56mm","N/A"

Pure chrysocolla is a soft and fragile material. Much of the chrysocolla used in jewellery consists of very attractive cabochons of green or blue chrysocolla impregnating either rock crystal or opal. 

Chrysocolla is often found in a matrix of quartz, in which case the optical and physical properties may be closer to those of quartz. 

Chrysocolla covered by druses of small sparkling quartz crystals is called ""Drusy Chrysocolla"" and is very popular for jewelry. It is found in Peru.

The rarest and best quality is chrysocolla chalcedony with turquoise-like colour, but harder and chemically more stable than turquise. It comes from several copper mines in Arizona, Mexico, Taiwan and Peru.

Many varietal names are given to Tektites from different localities. 

Moldavites are oval or spherical specimens of pale or bottle-green colour with few included bubbles and less obviously flattened from the Radomilice area of southern Bohemia, Czech Republic.

Bikolite is a name given to Tektites from the Bikol area of the Philippines.

Australites are button-shaped glass pieces found in South Australia and Tasmania. Billitonites are dark brown specimens found on Billiton Island between Sumatra and Borneo. 

Darwinites or Queenstownites are silica-rich and alumina-poor colourless to olive green to black specimens from Jukes-Darwin field near Queenstown, Tasmania.

Tektites can be distinguished from the much more abundant volcanic glasses (obsidian) by their negligible water content. A small splinter of tektite will fuse quietly in a flame to a droplet of glass, whereas a splinter of obsidian will froth up and expand in a flame owing to its small water content turning into steam.","https://www.gemdat.org/gphotos/0026909001351604213.jpg","Moldavite","Czech Republic","Natural","None reported","Oval","9.63 cts.","18.0mm x 13.5mm x ?","N/A"

Moldavite is a natural glass, a variety of Tektite. Tektites are formed when terrestrial rock and soil is melted and ejected into space by meteorite impacts, and each impact produces a limited strewn field which is named. Consequently the name ""moldavite"" can only be used for tektites from one specific impact (in this case the Ries crater in Germany), the strewn field being mainly in the Czech Republic, together with minor neighboring areas of Germany and Austria. It is nonsense for other glasses to be marketed using variations of the name like ""African Moldavite"" (sic).

Moldavites are the most transparent of all the various types of tektites. They are found in many different color shades between brown and green, but normally only the ones with bottle-green hue are used for faceting. Occasionally faceted green bottle glass gets fraudulently passed off as ""moldavite"". True moldavite gems can be identified by their vermiform inclusions of lechatelierite (pure silica glass - melted quartz).","https://www.gemdat.org/gphotos/0026909001351604213.jpg","Moldavite","Czech Republic","Natural","None reported","Oval","9.63 cts.","18.0mm x 13.5mm x ?","N/A"

188,"Amber","Amber is the fossilized, hardened resin of trees, ranging in age from less than a million to more than 300 million years old. Tree resin, initially a sticky semi-liquid, first hardens by losing volatile components, which evaporate into the air over periods from a few days to a few years. This is followed by a second stage of hardening in which the resin molecules polymerize (link with each other to form larger molecules), a process which can take anywhere from several tens of thousands of years to millions of years. After polymerization the amber becomes insoluble (or much less soluble) in organic solvents like acetone, toluene, alcohol, or gasoline. Young tree resins (sometimes known as ""copal"") are often misleadingly marketed as ""amber"", or euphemistically as ""young amber"", but the term Amber should properly be limited to the ancient polymerized resins that do not become sticky again when a drop of organic solvent is applied. On the other hand, the most ancient ambers (early Cretaceous or older) tend to become too brittle to use in jewelry.

True amber of lapidary quality comes mainly from the Baltic region (principally Poland and Lithuania), with some production also in Mexico (Chiapas), the Dominican Republic, and Burma. Most so-called ""amber"" marketed from Colombia and Madagascar is much too young to qualify as true amber.

Amber is mostly drop or nodular shaped with a homogeneous structure, it has yellow and brown colour. Inclusions of insects or parts of plants are common.

Amber is an ancient biological gem material. One of the earliest examples of worked amber are beads from Gough’s cave in southern England, dated 11 000–9000 BC.","https://www.gemdat.org/gphotos/0169600001350299929.jpg","Amber","Poland","Natural","None reported","Hexagon Cabochon","2.24 cts.","N/A","N/A"

Opal is divided into three subgroups: Precious Opal, yellow-red Fire Opal, and Common Opal. Their physical properties vary considerably. Precious Opal is conspicuous amongst all others for the magnificent play of colours produced by the refraction and reflection of light in its colourless substance.

The lustre is usually of the common vitreous type, though in some opals it may be greasy, resinous, or waxy. The lustre of natural specimens is only moderately strong, it is increased by cutting and polishing, but even then is in no way remarkable. Both common and precious varieties of opal are, as a rule, cloudy, being at the best only translucent or semi-transparent.

Tourmaline varies in transparency and colour to a considerable extent. Crystals of tourmaline may be of uniform colour throughout or differently coloured in different portions. The dichroism is a very prominent feature; it is apparent in quite pale-coloured stones, but is more marked in the darker varieties.

A very characteristic feature of tourmaline is the readiness with which it becomes electrified. By heating and subsequent cooling, as well as by applying pressure, e.i. by rubbing, a tourmaline crystal will become electrically charged. It will then attract dust particles as well as small pieces of paper (pyro- and piezo-electricity).","https://www.gemdat.org/gphotos/0901952001343829472.jpg","Paraíba Tourmaline","Brazil","Natural","None reported","Oval","1.77 cts.","N/A","N/A"

917,"Cassiterite","The name derived from Greek ""kassiteros"" - tin, for its composition.

Facet rough is uncommon but can yield gems of exceptional fire, because of its high lustre and dispersion. With a hardness of 7, approximately the same as that of the quartz gems, cassiterite is occasionally marketed for wearable jewelry in Bolivia (""Andean diamond""), but is normally restricted to rare gem collections.

Although cassiterite is a common mineral, being the main ore of tin, it's crystals are usually black or opaque brown and of no use as a gemstone. Only a few localities yield gem quality material, which ranges from colorless to yellow to pale brown. Bolivia has traditionally been the main source of gem rough, with the Viloco mine there being the only one of Bolivia's 300 or so tin mines that occasionally yields transparent crystals. However in the late 1990s, Russia and China yielded larger transparent crystals than Bolivia. Other sporadic sources of facetting grade cassiterite include Nigeria and Namibia. 

The ""wood tin"" variety of cassiterite is massive, tough, internally micro-fibrous, opaque, and finely colour banded, being related to crystallized cassiterite the same way agate is related to quartz. As with cassiterite crystals, wood tin generally is found in black or brown tones, but it is used for cabochons when it is found (rarely) in more attractive colors like red, pink and creamy white.

Many stones, which in the natural condition are of a dirty yellow colour and unsuitable for gems, on being heated acquire the fine carnelian colour, and with it a considerable increase in value.

When held against the light, the colour variety shows stripes, natural carnelian shows a cloudy distribution of colour.","https://www.gemdat.org/gphotos/0733361001385075702.jpg","Carnelian","Mozambique","Natural","None reported","Square Cushion","3.84 cts.","9.84mm x ?mm x ?mm","N/A"
